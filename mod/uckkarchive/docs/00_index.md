# 00 — Documentation Index

**Path:** `docs/00_index.md`  
**Plugin:** `mod_uckkarchive`  
**Component:** `mod_uckkarchive`  
**Status:** Final target specification  
**Scope:** Index and navigation map for the clean `mod_uckkarchive` documentation set.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical index for the `mod_uckkarchive` documentation set.

The documentation defines the final target behavior for a self-contained Moodle activity module that provides:

```text
archive memory
media library management
content advisory governance
cultural sensitivity tagging
external/foreign media references
exportable archive/media packages
```

The documentation is used to guide code generation, implementation review, testing, backup/restore design, privacy coverage, service design, UI construction, and packaging.

---

## 2. Documentation mode

The documentation set uses this mode:

```text
DOC_MODE = final_state_specification
DOC_STYLE = descriptive
DOC_TARGET = build-ready module specification
```

Rules:

```text
Documentation describes the final target behavior.
Documentation does not preserve historical debate.
Documentation does not keep a gap register.
Documentation does not use acceptance-checklist process documents.
Documentation does not use release-notes process documents.
Documentation does not describe required features as future optional features.
```

---

## 3. Canonical architecture formula

`mod_uckkarchive` follows this architecture formula:

```text
Moodle-native on the outside.
Self-contained archive/media/content-advisory system on the inside.
```

Canonical module definition:

```text
mod_uckkarchive = self-contained Moodle activity module for archive memory, media library management, and content advisory governance.
```

The module is installed and governed as a Moodle module.

The module owns its internal archive/media/content-advisory domain.

---

---

## 5. Required alignment file

Every documentation-generation conversation must start from:

```text
docs/_alignment_variables.md
```

This file defines shared variables for:

```text
plugin identity
canonical paths
active documentation set
architecture formula
database tables
capabilities
file areas
media lifecycle
archive lifecycle
validation states
visibility values
provenance values
media relation types
content advisory subsystem
external works
foreign media references
export manifests
required code files
writing rules
```

Rule:

```text
If another document conflicts with docs/_alignment_variables.md, update the document to match the alignment variables.
```

---

## 6. Active documentation set

Generate and maintain these documents only:

```text

```

Every document must avoid:

```text

content advisories as only a JSON field
versionitem capability
hard dependency on tool_uckkintegrity
```

output classes
templates
AMD modules
privacy provider
backup/restore steps
tests
language strings
package structure

This documentation set defines the final target behavior for implementation. Code, tests, services, UI, backup/restore, privacy, content advisory governance, and packaging must conform to these specifications.
```
