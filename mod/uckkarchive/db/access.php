 *
 * It does not own:
 * - global UCKK registry permissions, which belong to local_uckk;
 * - course-format display permissions, which belong to format_uckk;
 * - challenge workflow permissions, which belong to mod_uckkchallenge;
 * - assembly workflow permissions, which belong to mod_uckkassembly;
 * - integrity case permissions, which belong to tool_uckkintegrity;
 * - reporting permissions, which belong to report_uckk.
 *
 * Archive service code must still enforce ownership, provenance, validation
 * state, visibility, retention, privacy, cultural protocol, restricted-data,
 * File API, and workflow rules. Capabilities are permission gates, not
 * automatic authority to bypass archive policy.
